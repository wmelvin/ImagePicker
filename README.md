# ImagePicker

*ImagePicker* is a desktop application for selecting images and saving the list to a text file for use in other applications. It is implemented using the [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) IDE for Free Pascal.


## Picking from a set of screenshots

The initial use-case for ImagePicker was to select screenshot images created by [TimeSnapper](https://www.timesnapper.com/) (mostly from an older version), or another screenshot tool, to extract specific screenshots to use in project documentation.
