Try **Claude Sonnet 4.5** via GitHub Copilot Agent mode in VSCode.

I am just starting to explore **agent-assisted coding** and trying to get my bearings in this new landscape. This was a very simple change request, and it made the change in one go.

Though it is out of favor now, at least in the US, I expect the model has a lot of **Pascal** in the training data. I built production software for work using Pascal, but that was years ago. *ImagePicker* is the only Pascal project I have now. It's probably done, but may still be useful for experiments.

(Edited)

wmelvin: Make one change to this Lazarus (Free Pascal) application. In the Main menu / Tools menu there is a 'Sort picks' option. Add a yes/no confirmation dialog prior to sorting the list of "picks" (image files).

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you add a confirmation dialog before sorting the picks. Let me first examine the main form file to understand the current implementation. 

Read `umainform.pas`, lines 1 to 100

Searched for text `mnuToolsSort` (`**/umainform.pas`), 3 results

Now let me read the implementation of the sort function: 

Read `umainform.pas`, lines 646 to 670

Perfect! I can see the sort function. Now I'll add a confirmation dialog using the standard `MessageDlg` function from the Dialogs unit. Let me check if Dialogs is already in the uses clause: 

Read `umainform.pas`, lines 1 to 10

Great! The `Dialogs` unit is already included in the uses clause. Now I'll modify the `mnuToolsSortClick` procedure to add a confirmation dialog before sorting: 

Using "Replace String in File"

```
umainform.pas +11 -7
```
Done! I've added a confirmation dialog to the 'Sort picks' menu option. The changes:

1. Added a `MessageDlg` call that displays "Sort the list of picks alphabetically?" with Yes/No buttons
2. The sort operation now only proceeds if the user clicks Yes
3. The dialog uses `mtConfirmation` type (question icon) and standard Yes/No buttons

The confirmation dialog will appear when the user selects Tools → Sort picks from the menu, and the list will only be sorted if they confirm by clicking Yes.

Made changes.
